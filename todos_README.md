# small things:
- the title is weird

# big things:
- things in the sidebar don't do anything
- the scene tab looks weird
- menu buttons and move download there
- select multiple objects in hierarchy
- select objects on the plane and rotate, move, scale together

# future things:
- tabs for each part so you can preview parts and not the entire thing
